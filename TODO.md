# TODO

## Little jobs
- Check if levels are normalised already. If not, then normalise them. 

- Check if nulls are present. If so - deal with them. 

## Big jobs
- Are river levels/rainfall seasonal? How will I deal with that?

- Is it really sensible to make a single model for all the rivers? How about a single model for all the gauges on a single river?
